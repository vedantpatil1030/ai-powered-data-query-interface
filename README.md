1.Project Overview
Project Name: AI Powered Data Query Interface
Description: The AI Powered Data Query Interface is a web application designed to
facilitate intuitive and efficient interaction with a MongoDB database. Leveraging AI
capabilities and voice recognition, this tool allows users to query data using natural language
and voice commands. It also includes functionality for generating PDF reports of query
results, making it a versatile tool for data analysis and reporting.
Goals:
    • User-Friendly Interface: To provide a user-friendly interface for querying data using natural language.
    • Voice Integration: To enable voice search for hands-free data querying
    • Dynamic Reporting: To generate PDF reports of query results.

2.Features
    • Natural Language Processing: Uses Google Gemini API to understand and respond to user queries in natural language.
    • Voice Search: Use Web Speech API to allow users to perform   searches using voice commands.
    • PDF Generation: Generate and download reports of query results using JSPDF.
    • Data Querying: Efficiently query MongoDB collections based on user input.

3. Technologies Used
    • Google Gemini API: For natural language processing and generating AI responses.
    • Web Speech API: Provides voice recognition functionality for hands-free searching.
    • JSPDF: Generates and manages PDF files for exporting query results.
    • MongoDB: Stores and manages the data queried by users.
    • ExpressJS: Framework for building the server-side application and handling HTTP requests.
    • NodeJS: Platform for executing JavaScript code on the server side.
    • BodyParser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in Express applications.
    • dotenv: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into process.env for configuration.

4. Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/vedantpatil1030/ai-powered-data-query-interface.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
    cd ai-powered-data-query-interface
3. Install Dependencies
npm install
4.Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
API_KEY = your_google_generative_ai_api_key
5.5.Start the Server
node index.js
6. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to `https://localhost:3001`

5. API Documentation
POST/api/chat
• Description: Handles user queries by processing them through AI and querying
MongoDB. Returns AI-generated responses and query results.
• Request Body: (json)
{
 “prompt”: “Describe the data you need”
}
• Response:
{
 “geminiresponse”: “AI-generated response based on the query”
}
• Errors: 500 Internal Server Error: Indicates a problem with the server or query
processing

6.How It Works
1. User Input: Users can type their queries or use voice commands to interact
with the application.
2. Query Processing: The backend processes the query to determine the
appropriate MongoDB collection and filter.
3. AI integration: The query results are sent to the Google Gemini API, which
generates a response based on the data.
4. Response Generation: The AI-generated response and the query results are
sent back to the frontend.
5. PDF Generation: Users can generate and download a PDF report of the query
results.
